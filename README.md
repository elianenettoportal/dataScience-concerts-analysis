# dataScience-concerts-analysis
This is my first Data Science project for the Udacity Course

This is my first project result of my course at Udacity to DataScience nonodegree. My goal is to follow the CRISP-DM  strategy to design the infraestructure. 
1- Understand the Business problem - three questions
  1.1 - What Venue sold more tickets (original or cover)
  1.2 - What category made more revenue
  1.3 - Is capacity related to earning
2- Create a Jupyter Notebook
3- Communicate by Github and a Midium Post


The libraries used are numpy, panda and babel.numbers

My motivation to this project is to make my first entrance in the Data Science World. I wanted to make it at least a start, knowing that there are improvements in the code and also in the analysis. Anyways, I believe the main reason of sharing it is to gather knowledge andd learn from anyone willing to colaorate.
